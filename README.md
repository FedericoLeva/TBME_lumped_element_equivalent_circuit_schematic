# TBME_lumped_element_equivalent_circuit_schematic

An LTSpice schematic built following the methdology proposed in the main paper to study the neruon/planar-electrode interaction is supplied to give examples of transient simulation analysis. 
The main schematic is "Leva_et_al_TBME_equivalent_circuit_schematic.asc" and it is ready to be used once the user has properly installed the LTSpice simulation software. 
Similar results can be obtained with the PSpice simulation software tool by properly adjusting the code.
